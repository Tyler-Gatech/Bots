The Play Gym by Lovevery; Stage-Based Developmental Activity Gym & Play Mat for Baby to Toddler|"All 3 of my kids love it. It’s definitely a must have piece of baby gear!
            "|Derek &amp; Victoria|November 27, 2017|Verified Purchase|5|"I am a mother of 3, and I wish I’d had this mat from the beginning. I was skeptical that a baby play gym could really be worth $140, especially because I thought pretty much all other play gyms are completely overpriced for what you get, and not to mention, they are just plain ugly. My idea of what a play gym was, was based solely on the products currently on the market which were all basically just the same thing.I am SO happy to see ay that the Play Gym by Lovevery is nothing like the others, in all the best ways.The first obvious difference is that the frame for this is made from solid wood, which makes this Play Gym much stronger than anything else on the market. It’s soft and smooth, no chance of splinters and no sharp edges, every detail in this product has been carefully thought through, and it shows!It can hold up heavier toys, which your average mat will not. When I had my second son, my oldest would accidentally collapse the arms on our old mat by leaning against it or stepping on it and my baby got bashed in the face by a heavier hanging toy. Not an issue with this one, and I LOVE IT!Some reviewers have complained that the wooden frame is a downside because it doesn’t collapse easily, honestly I think that’s a plus for the reason above. No risk of it collapsing on my baby!The only thing slightly negative I have to say about the frame is that I wish the holes for hanging the toys were higher up the arms so they hung over the middle of the mat rather than on the sides. Still though, I don’t mind where they are.Now on to the mat itself. The texture is soft, but not slick like less expensive mats. My baby can actually get some traction to push herself up and isn’t just slipping all over it and getting frustrated. This mat also has some decent padding on it! We have wood floors so I’m not worried that she will smack her face on the floor when she is still learning to hold her head up and hurt herself. This would’ve definitely been an issue with our old one.I love the neutral tones of the mat, and the way that different areas of the mat can be opened and closed to prevent over stimulation and promote focus.The whole thing is so beautiful, it’s something that I can leave out and it doesn’t look like Toys-R-Us threw up in my living room, it actually adds to the decor/furniture in my opinion.The little booklet with all the Play ideas is probably my favorite part of the whole thing. It really takes the guesswork and research and puts it into an easy to understand format. You have the baby, you h e the tools, but how do you help your baby get the most out of play time? This book makes it SO easy! You don’t have to search through mountains of parenting books and blogs it’s all condensed Into a few short blurbs.I really can’t say enough good things about this. My daughter (9 weeks) absolutely loves the high contrast cards and the Montessori ball. My 5 and 3 year old boys ask me daily to turn it into a tent for them. It’s really a fantastic toy that grows with your child. I can’t wait to see all the new things we can/will do with this!TLDR: it’s the best. All 3 of my kids love it. It’s definitely a must have piece of baby gear!

The Play Gym by Lovevery; Stage-Based Developmental Activity Gym & Play Mat for Baby to Toddler|"Baby is fascinated by this gym, We love the developmental progress
            "|rqbanerjee|December 1, 2017|Verified Purchase|5|"Our 3-month old loves her morning play sessions on the Lovevery play gym. I am amazed by how long she can stay focused and attentive while lying on the gym. She is barely mobile (3 months), and from the middle of the mat, her focus usually goes to the high-contrast ball (in the picture), then to the high-contrast cards. This week, she has been enjoying the cards with baby face pictures. She actually coos at some of them, which is adorable.I'm enjoying seeing her progress from one area of the gym to the next as her brain develops. The thing I like the most as a parent is the Lovevery instruction manual. It has a pedagogically sound explanation of what stage our Eva's brain is in, what she can see, hear, and how she responds, and what the next stage will be. It tells you what type of stimulus is best for Baby, in weekly phases.We have a lot of books that tell us similar things about baby's development, but as a man of action I really appreciate being told what the next growth stage for our baby is, and what parts of the Lovevery gym to use to get her there. Love this product and I'm looking forward to my morning gym sessions with Eva for at least her first year.

The Play Gym by Lovevery; Stage-Based Developmental Activity Gym & Play Mat for Baby to Toddler|"The best activity mat and like no other!
            "|Molly M.|April 21, 2018|Verified Purchase|5|"In a word, wow!! This activity mat is fantastic. We have three kids and a lot of baby gear experience.  For our first two kids, we had one of the ubiquitous mats with lights, music and bright colors are over.  It was fine; the babies seemed to tolerate it, but I wouldn’t say they enjoyed it especially.  This play mat is simple and pleasant to look at.  No unnecessary lights and sounds that overstimulate baby.  There are five sensory experiences in various forms.  The hanging toys are at the perfect height for baby to kick, bat at and grab.  We especially love the interchangeable cards which include high-contrast images and mirrors.  At almost two months old, our little guy gets very excited to play on that mat, but he also enjoys quiet focus time with the cards. You can tell that a lot of careful thought went into this design. Unlike most activity mats, this one has the potential for longer term use.  Another neat feature is that it’s big enough for one or two of your older kids to play with the baby on it.  And the cover that can be used to make it a play tent is very fun. One of the best baby products we’ve had the pleasure to use.  Two thumbs way up!

The Play Gym by Lovevery; Stage-Based Developmental Activity Gym & Play Mat for Baby to Toddler|"Thoroughly impressed.
            "|East Coast Mom|June 22, 2018|Verified Purchase|5|"Well, wow. I was hesitant to spend this much money on a baby gym but the reviews and the longevity of use for this one convinced me.We only received it yesterday but I’m already so impressed. First of all it’s beautiful and feels high quality. I can’t say anything about durability yet. I love that there’s instructions for parents on how to play with it. My second child is only two weeks and she surprisingly shows interest in the high contrast flash cards (as I’m being instructed in the manual that she’s like that).For my first we had the skip hop treetop friends gym which she never had much interest in and I thought it was overall to busy. Also, it didn’t wash very well - sorry but spot cleaning with a damp cloth just doesn’t do the trick when somebody throws up hour-old milk.that being said, I’m hoping this one keeps its promise. It looks and touches amazing and I’m thoroughly impressed with all the thought that went into this. Can’t wait to play for the next year or so with it.

            "|Amazon Customer|November 12, 2017|Verified Purchase|5|"Love this new play gym! The setup only took a few minutes and was super easy and intuitive. I love that the frame is wood instead of plastic, and you can easily wipe it down. There are a few different areas for the baby to explore as they grow. Right now, my 7 month old is fixated on the wooden rattle and the mirrors. Definitely an upgrade from existing products.

            "|ebayseller|October 29, 2018|Verified Purchase|5|"I bought one first for my twin grandbabies in Germany.  My daughter is so happy with it and the attention to detail for little ones is wonderful.  It is sturdy, very well made, and comes with toys perfect for babies developmental stages, even a helpful booklet for parents on how to use the toys for each stage.  She recommended it so highly I bought a second one for my newest grandson here and I can watch him play on it and enjoy it.  I love the little cover that he will be able to use as his first little ""fort"".  It is so well thought out and so worth the money.  You won't regret buying it!

            "|Jenny|November 17, 2017|Verified Purchase|5|"I love my new Lovevery gym, and so does my baby girl!  In fact, she reached out and grabbed the wooden toy within seconds of being placed in the gym--her very first use of her hand as something other than a pacifier!  For me, probably the best thing about it is that it has a much longer useful life than a typical play gym--even able to convert into a play fort as she gets older.  If I had been able to buy this gym for my first child, I would have kept it until now, with my second baby.  It's a gorgeous, high quality product that doesn't look out of place in my home--totally worth the extra spend.  All the feels!! : )

            "|Mandi|February 9, 2019|Verified Purchase|1|"I really splurged on this because I didn’t want an “ugly” colorful mess in my living room,  we are tight on space so it’s going to be seen. and of course, I wanted the best for my little one!It got here and now that my baby is old enough to try it, it’s HUGE and although it’s beautiful with the wooden top...it’s insanely bulky and can barely fit through a doorway, so easy and quick assembly and dissaembly to put away while guests come over, etc. isn’t an option (which is so important when you are limited on space in your home!)Another disappointment for me is the 3 items that hang from it...they are places at very odd locations so if she lays in the middle she looks at nothing! You have to place your child in odd directions and all the way to the ends to see ONE hanging object, that right there makes me dislike this more than anything, because it’s simply not doing it’s job as being a baby gym!Mine also came missing one of the rings so that didn’t help my disappointment in this pricey item :(

            "|LLnyc|November 5, 2018|Verified Purchase|5|"As a FTM I had researched so many aspects of baby-care in preparation for our new arrival, but in the first few weeks I realized I was a bit clueless on expectations for how to entertain and exercise a brand new baby.Enter Lovevery. The play gym is a hit in our house.  Even from the first few weeks, the high-contrast cards and user friendly guide were so helpful. Baby was clearly stimulated by the designs, even at such a young age, which was a nice addition to our days filled with cluster feeding and diaper changes.Now, a few months in, baby's quickly becoming more and more engaged with each passing day. It's been incredible to watch him discover the new sensations and interactions he can have with his gym. The padded mat is the only place where  he'll tolerate tummy time. We also love that it washes super well and can hung on a drying rack for quick cleaning (for city peeps without in-unit driers).Last but not least... it looks great! inevitably a new baby = stuff and sometimes stuff all over... The gym is colorful and playful without being garish which we so appreciate :)Highly recommend!

            "|SaucyKatLady|August 31, 2018|Verified Purchase|5|"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this play gym. It is extremely well made, it breaks down to be compact for storage, it is beautiful and it is clever. The Parents cards come with milestone reminders and suggestions on how to help your baby meet those milestone through the gym and how to get your $$ worth. It truly is designed for your childs development from 0-12mths.You can also machine wash the base!!!!I did not do my research and put an infantino play gym on my registry. It also claimed to ""grow with your child"" because it was a turtle that could turn into a ball pit. It was cute but then i realized I hated how it looked. I couldn't just fold it and put it away. My baby seemed to out grow in in weeks. You couldn't machine wash the base. So we stopped using it and after weeks of kinda begging my husband (i think my baby was 4-5 mths by then) we splurged.We gave away our first play gym and we sold our activity center. This is all my baby needs.Also you have to check out the LOVEVERY monthly development boxes which are just as beautiful and goes along perfectly with the gym in quality and learning. Again wish I got those sooner but they were just released a month ago.

            "|Brittany Q.|August 11, 2018|Verified Purchase|5|"Absolutely beautiful, well crafted, and well-designed play gym. The wooden frame is sturdy and smooth. The 3 hanging toys connect with Velcro so you can attach different toys very easily. The flaps on the edges are very well thought out. I especially like the ""hide and seek"" pocket flap because you can add your own toys/items for baby to discover. The stand up portion for cards is very nice. It includes a mirrored card that baby loves. We were excited to find that a set of high contrast animal cards we received as a gift fit into the slots perfectly, making this even more versatile.I really didn't want to pay full price for this but I gave in and I'm so glad I did. It is far superior to other play gyms on the market and will last us a very long time. No regrets!

            "|Selena Hodges|November 26, 2017|Verified Purchase|5|"We are loving The Play Gym! As a mom I love that it’s durable. It’s not just foam bars that collapse and mush down anytime my three year old is around. The fabrics are soft and colorful.  I love the bars up high because as my baby gets older and is sitting we can still use the gym, because he will still fit under it. Most play gyms are done after they outgrow tummy time.  My kids are all loving the little tent that comes with it, another reason it will grow with my baby. My eight year old is loving going through the activity cards with the baby. They give us lots of info on milestones and different activities to do with the baby.  We leave it out 90%of the time. But it can be taken apart and put away for storage if needed. It just won’t pop back up like a foam one would.My little guy is five months old right now and enjoying tummy time in front of the high contrast cards and mirrors. But it comes wh other fun cards to easily swap out for as they develop. We are still discovering all the other fun flaps it comes with too. I feel like this is an investment piece and will last a long time for more than one baby. And those are the kinds of baby items I like the best!

            "|Allison|January 30, 2018|Verified Purchase|5|"Love this baby gym. I was going to buy some new toys for baby number 3 and found this baby gym online. I really liked it and it had amany of the tips that I planned to buy plus the tent feature. I decided to get this for him for Christmas. He was 4 months at the time. We have got a lot of use out of it already, the mat itself is very high quality and the wooden support frame is really nice.  It's sturdy enough to support heavier toys without worrying that it might collapse. I had a couple issues with the tent and the straps that hold the toys to the frame. I contacted the company and they were so kind and responsive.  They sent replacement parts and their customer service exceeded my expectations. I hope they come out with other products. I would gladly order from them again. All the items were of very high quality and will grow with my child. For reference my tall 4 year old can sit in the tent with his baby brother so we will get many more years of use from this product. My one complaint would be that the product images show a wooden teether ring with a fabric tied on and I got a silicone one instead of the wooden ring. Love everything else about it

At that age we used the black and white cards and I was surprised to see how he could focus on them and track them. Now that he is almost 6 months he enjoys laying on his back and batting the dangling toys. The wooden toy with the bell is his favorite! The card holder is great for displaying the cards and allowing baby to touch without ruining them. There is a good variety of subjects on the cards and these are fun to go through with your baby. This is the only baby item I have that continues to keep my little guy happy, hold his attention, and he never complains when I set him on it. The gym is also very nice looking. It really looks like a high quality item. I like the soft colors with splashes of brighter ones and the strong wooden frame. I have washed the mat twice and it has held up perfectly.

It is also soft and has been very easy to spot clean (spit up).Play guide: The book is so incredibly helpful! It is great knowing that I have an evidence based quick reference when it comes to how to engage my baby in play/mental stimulation.This play gym is more expensive than others, but it does feel like one of those baby items that is actually worth the cost.This would be a great baby shower gift.

            "|Sarah|September 27, 2018|Verified Purchase|5|"I absolutely love this play gym! It is everything I wanted and very solidly made. It is a good looking piece as well - nice enough to leave out most of the time.The best part of this gym is the activity booklet that comes with it. It tells you how to use the gym at each age/developmental level. My almost 3-month-old loves to kick the “sounds” zone and the hanging bell to hear the noises. He also loves to look at the Montessori ball as it swings or look at the black and white pattern cards during tummy time. Tummy time used to be his least favorite activity, but this gym has made it a little more bearable for him!If you are looking for something that is easy to take out and put away, this may not be your best option. You have to completely dismantle the top hinge and take out the wooden rods. When disassembled, it does store nicely, but it just isn’t as quick as the play gyms with the flexible rods (though the wooden rods are much sturdier and the setup seem safer than the “pop-up” type gyms).My ONLY complaint is that the material the the top of the mat is made of seems to be a magnet for hairs and lint. My kiddo was wearing black fleece pants on it and it is now covered in hard-to-remove fuzzies (not easily just brushed away). You may want to invest in a lint roller as well, especially if you have pets!Overall, I’d definitely recommend this play gym to others, despite the higher price point. It is definitely worth it! :)

The quality is the wooden toys, the fabric, and the design is top notch. I appreciate the fact that this comes with guidance for your baby’s developmental stages and how to use the play gym with them. They’ve really thought of everything... except how to make this a little easier to tuck out of the way when not in use. The gym itself comes apart easily, but I would like a bag or something to put it in with the mat, the toys, and the booklet so I don’t have to keep the box... just something a little more convenient.

We got it when he was about a month old.  We held off about a month after he was born to see if someone would buy it for us off our registry, and no one did... (big eye roll), so we sucked it up and bought it for ourselves.  We use it for tummy time, as well as for back time for our 4 month old to swat and grab for things.  He's teething, and he loves the silicone teethers.  We take them with us when we leave the house too!  I love that it grows with them and becomes a tent for them when they are older!  Not to mention it's cute, and not fussy or tacky looking!  Had to email them about something, and they were prompt and went above and beyond!  Love this company and this product!

However, I am so glad I did. Baby loves it. She spends so much more time on her tummy on this mat. She pulls on the little tabs and loves the baby pictures that come with it. We put on the play fort today and she was so excited. She loves being inside. She sat in there on her own for a while. I love the wooden toy, its so well made and she loves to tug at it or hit it with her feet. The two teething rings that come with it are also a big hit. If you do the math, teething rings x 2, well made wooden toy, Montessori ball, play mat, and play fort feature, pictures and activity book.  All these separately would cost you either the same or more. Currently thinking about purchasing their play kits. Highly recommend!!

I bought this play gym based on the fantastic reviews, the variety of stimulation activities and the modern look. However, it's the most boring play gym on this planet. My daughter had zero interest in the gym. The ball didn't even excite her. The mirror may be the only thing that caught her attention otherwise, she didn't like it at all. She loved her very colorful play gym we received as a gift. I still try to get her to use the Lovevery Play gym b/c it was so expensive, but again ZERO INTEREST.

This play gym addresses all of the issues that I had with play gyms and offers way more than I could have expected. It's base is designed in soft, neutral tones so it's aesthetically pleasing but also not super overwhelming for baby. It has several different areas for learning and stimulation which can be used and covered as needed. It's made of high-quality, safe materials and it really can grow with the baby. The toys are removable so you can use them long after you use the gym or add your own toys to switch things up. It's created with principles of development in mind so there are a variety of ways to engage your baby and it comes complete with a little book to give you tips for each stage. It's more expensive than most gyms but I think worth it considering the variety of options you have for learning and the fact that you can get use out of it for a full year or more compared with other gyms which will likely only last you a few months. It's about more than play, it's about engaging your baby's brain and I love that!

I love how many areas there are for you to turn an infant to as well and none of them are over stimulating. In the evening, I can leave him in the gym while we are making dinner and he will still easily go to sleep.The other piece of this gym I loved (which was very unexpected ) is it gave my 4 year old daughter a really nice and calm way to interact with her brother.

My son is 7 weeks old and we have been using it since we brought him home from the hospital! It is amazing how long he stays engaged using the high contrast cards (black and white). If I notice him begin to get restless, I flip over the card and it seems to settle him down and hold his attention! He spends anywhere from 20-50 minutes/day on the play mat! He is just starting to gain interest in the rattle and high contract ball- he will track the ball with his eyes and turn his head from side to side! We also use the play mat during ""tummy time"".

It makes me feel like a more confident parent and helps me feel like I'm truly involved in helping my child learn and grow. I am sure we will be able to use the mat beyond 1 year as well, judging by how much our 3.5 year old loves it. It will be easy to leverage the same materials and use them in ways that will continue to be developmentally appropriate even after 1 year of age.I love that the company has a mission to help educate you about your child's development while providing the tools to help you put it into action.

We chose this as the one new baby product we’d get for our second child since we still had so many from our first. Well - it was the best decision.First of all, it’s gorgeous with beautiful water color and black and white designs that are neutral enough to not make your playroom look like a mess, but entertaining for the little ones still.And then the function of it - it’s awesome. There’s an area where you fill in your choice of four sight cards (they are included) and you choose from developmentally appropriate pictures - for instance black and white patterns when they are tiny, and then pictures of facial features like eyes and noses, etc.It’s very spacious but not overwhelming - I’m thrilled that my toddler will be able to play with her little sister at the same time. And to that point - you can add a small tent cover to it (included) and my toddler absolutely loves it. It’s definitelt a play gym that grows with your child. Lovevery also includes a book with it that gives you specific ideas of how to best use the gym given your child’s age and it’s easy to read and I am so thankful for it - even as a second time Mom.So - if you’re debating, do it. I’m so thrilled with this purchase and I took a long time debating because of the price - well it’s definitely worth it! You can see more pictures of them in action on Instagram if you have one (@lovevery) which is how I found them.We actually used our registry completion discount to get it slightly discounted - so if you have an amazon registry make sure to add this and use your discount at the end if needed!!!!

The ""learn to focus"" board would be better with support for the fold flap to resist babies collapsing it and contorting it against the wooden post behind it: I've got a roll of another play mat thing to give it support for when my baby climbs over it. The ""how things feel"" area was a bit of a disappointment in that the different materials really aren't all that different: the grosgrain ribbon texture is repeated as is the cotton feeling ones. And realistically the panels do not stay folded over once babies are on there & wiggling around. But at least everything is beautiful to look at and not overly busy. I like the cards it comes with and suggested ways to play with it at difference developmental stages.

It’s clear how much thought and detail went into the design of this product. Everything is very well made beautiful. I love that you can fold the fabric over the different play stations so that it looks less cluttered when not in use and doesn’t overstimulate while baby’s playing. The booklet that comes with it is also great - full of information on how to use the gym through various developmental stages. We haven’t used the tent, yet, but can’t wait to try it out! We’ve washed the mat a few times and it does great in the washer. We have an air dry (no heat) feature on our dryer that we use for this and we haven’t had any problems. Really, I could go on and on about how much I love this thing. I think you definitely get what you pay for and more with this one.

So far, she has been focusing on the cards and the hanging wooden toy a lot. I also have caught her checking out the ball quite a bit...seems like she is getting ready to play with it more. One thing I didn't expect was the big activity guide that came with the gym.

She is 3 months now and has been loving looking in the mirrors during tummy time and hitting the bell with her hands and feet.  She is just starting to get really interested in the crinkly parts and grabbing at them during tummy time.  Before this stage she was very into starring at the flash cards and black and white ball.  We took some of the flash cards out and put them out in our diaper changing station for her to look at.  I really like that his product will turn into a tent when she no longer needs a play gym.  I also like how the parts are attached - they feel very secure.  It's nice that you can take the hanging toys off to use them for different things.***Update: 8 months old and still totally obsessed with the bell toy.  Also now interested in rolling around and turning around to play with the crinkly parts and ribbons.

The infant development reminders and activities are helpful - and the interactivity of the mat and accessories are wonderful. Parents do have to be careful of putting baby down and picking baby up near the wooden toy that dangles down - and as the baby begins rolling over more, parents have to be careful of baby placement in proximity of wooden arms of the gym.Great quality overall!  Only wish they sold the accessories for the play gym separately - and added a few new accessories for the different developmental stages.

            "|K.L.|July 4, 2018|Verified Purchase|5|"My baby is 10 weeks and he is mesmerized by this gym. Yesterday he laid on his back and looked at the hanging objects for 45 minutes while vigorously kicking his legs and swinging his arms. Usually he can’t go this long without wanting me to pick him up. However he still hates tummy time and the gym doesn’t make him like it any better. But I love the soft cushy mat that gives him adequate protection and comfort even on our hard wood floor, so in a way the gym is encouraging more tummy time. Most importantly, as my baby becomes more aware and active, the gym gives me a way to entertain him. Being a first time mom I am often at a loss as to what to do with my baby when he’s wide awake, not hungry or wet. The gym is a wonderful entertainment center.Taking off 2 stars for durability because the Velcro strap that holds one of the toys was coming apart out of the box, and the other 2 Velcro straps also do not look very sturdy. Seems like not enough attention to details for such an expensive item.

He would play on the mat for as long as I let him. We’ve had it for over two months now and he still loves the rattle, the ball, not super into the teethed yet (he’s only 4 months). We do tummy time on it which is great because the colors, textures, sounds, and pictures distract him from how much he hates tummy time. It will grow with your baby and I look forward to him using all the developmental pieces in the future. Also I swear his fine motor skills are great because if that rattle.

They were incredibly responsive when I needed a part replaced (after my dog chewed it up - even the pup loves this playgym!).There are lots of playgyms out there, I know.

It did not disappoint. The Play Gym is absolutely beautiful with soft colors and a very attractive overall aesthetic.  I clearly wasn't the only one who was impressed - by the time I had it open, my almost 3 year old was sitting on the mat naming the colors and counting the soft ribbons.  My 18 month old was giggling as she shook the surprisingly non-annoying bell (thank you!!).  After clearing out the siblings, I laid my 1 month old on the mat and unfolded the focus area.  I wasn't sure what to make of the black and white focus cards and was completely blown away by her intense focus on them!  She actively focused on them for 15 minutes before deciding it was also a comfortable place to snooze :)  I started flipping through the play guide and love the reminders of different phases of development - it's so easy to get caught up in the moment and forget about all the awesome things happening in your baby's brain.  I can't wait to watch our youngest grow with the Play Mat and see how she engages with the other features.  I know they are all going to love it once we add the covering to make the fort...definitely wish we had had this for my two older daughters.

I thought he would have totally grown out of play mats/activity centers but the lovevery play gym has tons of options for him. The strong wooden frame has been really good as he practices pulling him self up and stabilizing. And he's been enjoying all the mirrors and learning cards. Best part for us is that it looks much nicer than many of the neon play gyms so it blends into our home

            "|Sandy|November 29, 2017|Verified Purchase|5|"Seriously, I wish this had existed when my baby was born so I didn't have to (buy and) have the eyesore of my previous play gym in my living room for 5 months!  Thank goodness it came around in time to replace the old one and enjoy for many months (years (?) with the ability to turn it into a play tent!) to come.  I love the simple design, the ability to cover sections that aren't being used, the area to display favorite flash cards (and change them out to keep it fresh), and the non-overwhelming hanging toys that my baby is totally into.  Plus, it comes with a book to guide age appropriate play/activities in the gym that is organized by baby's age, and they're simple and easy to follow.If you are pregnant and looking for the perfect play gym, this is it.  If you already have a baby and are cursing the baby toy world for this not being released in time for your shower, replace the old one with this one.  Considering that it includes pretty much everything you need to play with your baby over the first year, converts into an attractive tent for the second year and beyond, and works with an adult living room aesthetic better than any baby product I have seen, it's a no brainer.

            "|Joeyyungrocks|August 6, 2018|Verified Purchase|4|"Yes, the price was pretty steep for a play mat.  I am still feeling the guiltiness of spending that much money but overall, I find it worth it.  There's an educational little booklet that educates the parent on the crucial milestones the baby should be hitting and recommends exercises to guide the baby.  I find that other mats seem too overly decorated and busy that I don't know if that helps the child in any way.  This has enough included in the mat (little tags and items to attach to the frame and the mat) without it overwhelming the child.  It's very classy looking and helps you do the necessary things to help the baby focus on developing skills.  A fun fact about this mat is that my baby loves looking at the card/display with another baby's face.  He's tried screaming/talking and even put his face up closes to the card.

He will remain focused on the high contrast cards but I constantly find him looking up and unfortunately there is nothing there for him to look at. I ended up adding some little toys so he has something to gaze at. I also find myself grabbing a musical toy I have so he can move around to the sounds which he likes doing. Maybe as he gets older he will be more engaged without the need of the music and added stimulation above his head but currently he still prefers his play mat that lights up and plays music. This mat however is great for engaging with your baby as you learn about your baby’s developmental milestones.  You can see the additions I made to this mat in my photos.

The colors aren’t overwhelming and the material is soft and cushioned. My daughter loves the ball and pics (currently using the contrast images) so far! Due to the wood frame, I am able to hang multiple other items such as Velcro animals and play mirror without any worry the frame won’t hold up. That’s awesome! I wish there were more options for the mobile toys but that’s not a big deal. The only negative which I hate to point out is that the color visuals (exploring colors section) is beginning to show signs of minor wear and tear (Small loss of thread). I am not sure how this happened so fast. I followed the care instructions to wash. Overall I am happy with this purchase but with the price point and the short time frame I’ve owned this product I am not sure how long  that piece of the the mat will last. I still do highly recommend the mat as i think it provides a variety of sensory activities for the little ones.

As a 4th time parent, honestly I thought: “how can a playgym be worth that price tag?” My other kids played with them hardly at all and the ones we had were obnoxious looking, with toys that were not based in infant development science. They seemed more designed to just attract parents as a novelty and keep babies entertained for 2 minutes to get a break.This one I feel is actually capturing the interest of my 2 month old and has since she was just a few weeks old.I do wish the mat was more plush. I have a sheepskin in there so it is comfy on our wooden floor.Also it is adorable and it’s minimalistic design + neutral colors look nice in my living room as opposed to the ones that look like a rainbow threw up on the mat.I’m including a video of my 9 week old who has figured out how to hit one of the items in the mat now. She loves it. The toys lay at the perfect distance for them to choose to play or just look.My 4 year old also loves to lay under the canopy with her. I think we will enjoy it for many years.

So far there are a few things I'm disappointed in and one thing I wish was different.1. My mat is falling apart, all the center stitching has come undone and became a choking hazard cause of all the loose strings2. The feel section, most of them don't really have different textures for her to test on3. The attach case to pad, it's not close enough to the leg to lean upon so my little one can see herself, I have to prop it up more with something else to angle it better.4. Transportation, unfortunately it's long so I can't pack it to go with us without putting it back in the box. Maybe put hinge in the legs or something so it can compact more. That's what we are doing to ours so we can take it around.(Update) 5. It attracts every bit of lint and loose strays, I have to wash it regularly and holding up well seems a challenge it's become puffy, I iron it to get it back to shape. Also I did end up stitching in different textures into the feel area of the mat to give her some variety.This is such an expensive mat and wish I could say it was fully worth the price

This is unlike any play gym available.  Other gyms look tacky, toxic, and overwhelming for young minds.  The quality and supplemental guidance of this play gym kit is superb.  At first I just thought of it as a pretty play gym, but have since been blown away by the quality of craftmenship, the forethought, and the organic, sustainable components.  This company knows what parents want and what babies need to maximize their physical and mental growth.  I absolutely love the easy to use, step by step developemental guide that is included.  My husband and I now know exactly how to use each element according to our baby's stage.  Our 3 month old baby girl hated tummy time and hence was falling a little behind in her muscular development.  In a matter of a few days, we've already seen dramatic improvements in her physical abilities and self motivation.  Without this she was unmotivated to even lift her head.  On day four of using this gym, she not only was happily lifting her head, but rolled over for the first time.  We did not expect this kind of physical response.  After witnessing the quality of this company's products and prompt customer service, I am very excited to also subscribe to the Lovevery Play Kits to further aid in the development of our sweet baby girl's mind and body.  Thank you Lovevery so much for helping our little girl quickly catch up to speed and put our minds at ease.  Thanks to your product we are relieved to say that our family can finally actually enjoy tummy time now that it no longer feels like a reluctant chore.We too will be gifting this gym at future baby showers!

            "|GAIL L KOCH|January 3, 2019|Verified Purchase|4|"We ordered this play gym for our daughter and we used it a ton in her first 6 months of life. I loved how soft the mat was, and how there were so many little ""play"" areas on it for her to keep her focus. My favorite aspect of this product were all the cards we could swap out for her to look at — from pictures of other babies, to mirrors, to black and white and other objects, these were so versatile and we could use with the mat or without. If I had one critique it's that the beautiful wooden rattle that hangs from the gym is a little heavy. A time or two it ""beaned"" my daughter in the head, so we removed it (easy to do) and let her use it as a hand rattle that we kept in our diaper bag. I'm gifting this to my niece who is expecting because I know she'll get great use out of it too!PS — And talk about great customer service: I reached out to Lovevery asking if they could send me another box for the play gym so I could send it on to my niece (it comes in a long rectangular box and it's hard to package up with it), since I'd long recycled ours. They got back to me SO quickly and were so nice about sending me a new box. One of the great perks of purchasing an item from a small company that really cares!

            "|Brickle|January 29, 2019|Verified Purchase|3|"It was a splurge to get this but I loved how it looked and thought I’d give it a chance.  Unfortunately, my 3 month old wasn’t at all interested while on the mat.  The three hanging toys were not enough to keep her happy for more than a couple minutes before she was bored.  I thought the cards/mirrors for her to look at would catch her interest but again only for a couple minutes.  I wanted to love this mat as I loved how it looked.  It was subdued while having fun colors for the baby.  If there was more to look at visually while baby was on her back looking up, maybe it would have worked.  It seems like a baby who wanted to be on their belly would enjoy this mat more but even on her belly mine did not.  I also loved the idea that this could be a little fort once the baby was older but the fabric didn’t secure nicely in my opinion and was loose.  I wanted to love this play mat but it didn’t work for us.  I returned it and can say she’s happier with her Jonathan Adler Fisher Price play mat.  She loves the hanging toys/mirror and lights with that one.

            "|jason|November 21, 2017|Verified Purchase|5|"Love, love, love!!  I can't say enough great things about this play gym.  From the packaging to the actual pattern on the mat you can tell that this is an extremely well thought out product.  It has everything you need to aid your baby in his/her development over the first 12 months.  I love that the activity guide walks you through exactly what activities you should be doing with your baby at each age range.  I didn't have a play mat/gym with my first baby as I read from quite a few sources that they can often overstimulate baby with the crazy colors and too many moving parts. Plus, so many of the materials they are made out of are not what I'd want to be putting my face on so why would I put my baby on it!?  The fact that the materials are organic and responsibly made gives me peace of mind!  This mat also takes away the struggles I know I personally had with my first in coming up with activities for development at each stage.  This gives you all the tools you need in one spot!  While the product is more expensive than others on the market it lasts a significantly longer time as far as use period (newborn -12 months vs only a couple months if that) and comes with way more features/instructions.  Well worth the price.  Definitely something I am adding to my recommended ""must have's"" list for new moms!  You won't be disappointed! -  (Jason's Wife) :)

She loves the teething toy, and it’s still her comfort object at 11 months old. We loved the materials, it’s easy to wash and care for, and it’s such a lovely addition to the room- not like the plastic eyesore gyms we saw online. Our daughter still uses the play gym every day, and she’s old enough to start engaging with more of the different stations. It was a great purchase.

I was highly skeptical that it would be worth the money but I loved the idea behind it.After using other similar items we had been given I found that they were all lacking. I found the fabrics were slick, overhead bars were weak, and overall the toys were terrible quality. That is where the lovevery gym filled those voids.The fabric on this gym is a perfect texture so she doesn't get frustrated from sliding all over. The bars are sturdy and well made. The toys all have a purpose and are made of organic, high quality, materials that I feel comfortable giving to my daughter. Most importantly? SHE LOVES THE GYM.We use the gym every single day. She will play for hours and at times it is the only thing that makes her happy. That alone is worth the investment.The deciding factor that pushed me to get the gym was the fact that is exactly that, an investment. I wasn't getting it just for my daughter now but also for any children we have in the future. I know that this product is durable and will last. Hands down the best.

I'm really impressed with the quality which I'm glad because I was really on the fence about the price of this item. I ended up purchasing this as its for our first so I feel like we can invest in quality items now that will last through kid #2 or #3. I definitely feel like this will last for many years of play. It doesn't feel cheap and I'm not worried this will collapse on my baby. I'm also impressed by this company with their book of how to play with your child. I love that the first section is all positive comments for the parent to take a moment and realize you are doing a good job. As I imagine there will be times we feel overwhelmed so I'll take all the positivity I can get. I loved this quote they have in their play book "" Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do"" - Benjamin Spock.PS the box showed there is a teething ring include but I didn't see it. I reached out to Lovevery customer service and they said it's in the hide and find area so take a look there before you think it's missing like I did!

Even though it would have looked beautiful under our tree on Christmas morning, I could wait no longer to order it! After learning about the company and all of the research behind their products (the play gym and subscription play kits) I was sold on the company’s mission. With one week left of maternity leave, I decided to go ahead and order the play gym on Amazon so that it would arrive quickly and give me time to soak up every moment with my sweet baby as honestly, the greatest gift we can give our kids is our time- all year round- and that was more important than waiting until Christmas morning.The play gym is beautiful and so incredibly soft making play time, tummy time and unrestricted floor time (which is one of many important activities shared in the accompanying play guide) so much more enjoyable!My only regret is not ordering it sooner as my baby is about to turn 12 weeks old. However, he still has many years of play left as evident by his four year old sister that can’t get enough of the play cover making it into a fort!If you’re a nerd like me that wants to give your baby the best start at life backed by tons of research, then this play gym is for you too! As a full time working mom now with two kids, I simply don’t have time to do all the research I wish I could on child development. Lovevery has taken out the guess work and given me the tools to spend the limited precious time I have just enjoying my baby (and big sister too!).

There is so much to do/see/explore! The best part is it comes with a book of what to do and when for development at different stages throughout the first year. I often struggled before with what to do with my infant to make sure they are learning all of the skills they need to. And I usually just ended up putting her in a bouncer/swing/froggychair until she fussed then I’d rotate to the next. But with this play mat, I now feel confident in playing with my baby and nurturing her developmental needs.

Though this play gym is definitely on the pricier side, I truly believe it is worth the investment.

After talking to a friend who works in child development (and receiving a generous Amazon gift card!) I went with the Lovevery gym.So far we are really happy with that decision!  The wooden legs are sturdy and were easy to assemble. The hanging toys are really high quality. My son especially loves the bell clapper - he kicks it and bats at it constantly. The high contrast cards and mirror have also been big hits. And the mat itself is easy to clean - I recommend washing it in the evening so it has overnight to hang dry. That way you're not without it during the day!The activity booklet is also really useful. It describes stages of development as your baby grows, and suggests activities to do with your baby on the mat. Can't wait for him to get interested in the various ""play zones"" as he gets older - he already loves the crinkly noises in the Sound zone!The price can be a bit daunting, but I've found the mat to be worth it.

            "|btaniguchi|January 11, 2019|Verified Purchase|5|"I love how easy it is to assemble this play gym. The legs are held together at the top rather than requiring you to get the spacing and tension right to keep them upright. There is also no worry about your baby accidentally kicking one of the legs or one of the legs getting bumped and causing it to collapse. The materials the activity gym is made out of so much nicer and stronger than our previous one. The color scheme of the mat is a great neutral when it is all closed up and put away so I don't mind it being in my living room and I don't feel like it is an eye sore to look at. We are in a smaller space right now, so having baby gear that is nice to look at is a great change from our older gear. The mat also has a nice layer of padding in it. We have hardwood floors and their isn’t a need to add anything under it.I also love all of the different areas of play for tummy time. There are four different areas that can be open or closed. I love how this doesn't overwhelm my newborn, but also entertains my three year old. This activity mat focuses on my baby's developmental stage and provides me with an easy guide to follow for first year. As a mom of more than one kid, I enjoy being able to quickly read through the guide and be reminded of my baby's developmental stage. It is so easy to follow and use  giving me more time to spend playing and bonding with my kids.The cover creates a fun creative space that my three year old loves to play in with her toys and the different areas on the mat too.The thought and planning that went into this activity mat makes it better than every other activity mat on the market, from the quality of the materials to the specific areas on the mat to the toys that come with it.  This activity mat is well built, thought out, and designed. It shows in every area of the mat.  As an added bonus entertains your older kiddos as well :). This is worth every penny spent on it.

Even the packaging was beautifully. It was also very easy to assemble, which is a huge selling point!2. This Montessori-inspired play gym makes it fun to play with your new baby because it offers so many intentional activities. Most play mats I've seen just have a few animals hanging from the arches & maybe a couple of squeaky toys, but this actually provides learning experiences. The mat has four ""sections"", so you can position your baby on one of the four sections to have a specific kind of playtime. One section has little pockets sewn into the mat so you can play peek-a-boo; another section has a variety of textured fabrics so you can have a sensory moment. (So the true mom confession is that you can leave baby on this mat for a while & not feel like he/she has just been dumped somewhere -- baby will truly benefit & be entertained!)3. The BEST thing about this mat is that it will grow with your child. Most play mats have very low-hanging arches, so once baby is rolling & sitting up, the play mat serves no purpose because he/she is now ""too big"". The Lovevery play gym has a much higher canopy so it will accommodate an older baby. It even comes with a canopy that can be attached over the wooden bars to turn it into a tent! And all kids love tents!Overall, I am very impressed with this product & would highly recommend it to friends who are putting together a baby registry in the near future. It's a much better investment than any other play gym I've ever seen in stores.

            "|B|January 14, 2019|Verified Purchase|5|"In a world where baby stuff is largely crazy colors, the simplicity of this play gym was a welcome addition to our home. It’s easy to take apart and stores pretty small - though we wish there was a storage bag! That may be the only thing we feel is missing from this gym, though. The guide helps us feel like we are really helping our baby develop and have fun ways to play with her. It’s been fun to watch her move through the developmental stages. First she loved the high contrast images and could practice concentrating on them for long periods of time, now at three months she’s moved up to playing intentionally with the hanging toys. It keeps her entertained and learning while we get things done! I love that the hanging toys easily detach for added fun and flexibility. This gym is versatile and has way more options for play and learning than the average gym. While pricey, you’re getting more than just a gym. You get the knowledge of the guide with tons of ways to use the gym, the hanging toys that can be used separately, the mat full of activities, lovely minimal design, a fun fort that’ll be used for years to come, and peace of mind. We love our lovevery play gym.

            "|Elm Savannah|August 10, 2018|Verified Purchase|5|"We got our Lovevery Play Gym in March of 2018 when our daughter was 6 weeks old. It was a hit with all of us from the start. It was delivered on a Sunday, which was kind of cool. The packaging was great, and it was very easy to put together. Right away, we appreciated the thickness of the mat and sturdy frame. We loved the appearance, and the Play Gym has been up and played with daily since March.Now 7 months old, our daughter has played with and enjoyed nearly every part of the gym. (We haven’t made it into a tent yet.) When she was smaller, she loved batting and kicking the wood batting ring and kicking the crinkly noise area. She used the high contrast cards early on, but loves the photos of other children and pets/objects now. The mirrors have been, and continue to be, a hit. It was perfect for making tummy time interesting with new experiences for her as the days and weeks passed.She discovered the organic teething ring at about 3 months and has been loving it ever since. She has just about worn out the fabric strip. When she picked some threads loose, we wrote to the company. On the same day, they sent us a replacement. She loves to chew and crinkle the fabric strip.She has grown to really love the high contrast ball, and she and her Dad roll it back and forth each evening.She learned to roll from back to tummy and tummy to back on the mat. The fabric is attractive and soft, but it’s also durable. Her 2 year old cousin was drawn to it when visiting and sat right in the middle of it with muddy shoes. We washed it, and it looked new. Our dog with storm phobia broke into the nursery and urinated on it. We washed it (after a lot of swearing), and it STILL looked new.The different textures to feel are a new favorite, the crinkly parts, and now being allowed to hold and gnaw the wooden teether with bell have made new games of parts that are old favorites. We are starting to enjoy hiding and finding.We fogies enjoy the book and find it reassuring that our girl is ahead of and right where she should be developmentally. We have enjoyed the suggestions of what to play with and when, since we were not experienced “baby people” when we became parents.I looked at different playmats for weeks: I wanted this one, but it seemed expensive. It was in my Amazon cart for two weeks before I just bit the bullet and ordered it. I wish I’d gotten it sooner. It did not disappoint, and I think it has kept us from purchasing a lot of other less satisfactory products. I also think that has meant less clutter in our very clutter-prone lives.I would buy it again. I wish I’d had it ready and waiting for her when she came home from the hospital. I’m impressed with the company and their customer service, and we love this product!! If they made other items, I’d buy those, too!

I can tell I will be keeping this for some time, and I love that it converts into a little tent for when your child gets older. She loves the high-contrast images and for now, until she gets older, it is a great place to set her down so I can get some things done and keep her entertained in the meantime (she is 2.5 months old). I love the design, the dangle toys that come with. I also have other little toys that I switch out and dangle on the wood framing. Every day she grows she is doing more and more on the play gym and it is fun to watch her! The activity cards this comes with is also helpful.Also -- side note, really enjoyed the packaging it comes in. totally was expecting some generic Amazon box with packing plastic and foam.  Considering you are dropping a pretty penny on this children's product, it is a nice and fun unboxing experience designed by the company.

I am already a subscriber to the Play Kits and the addition of the Playgym is an added bonus to our child's development. We now have one space to utilize all the toys while we are at home, and the kits allows us to travel and play. I'm a first time mom and one of the things that I was struggling with was toys and understanding what would keep our baby entertained, while also stimulating her development. I also, did not know what she needed at every stage and month during her first year. The Lovevery playgym and kits solves all of that, the reading material provided with the playgym, educates the parents on our baby's development throughout the first year and how to use all of the playgym's features. I love coming home and playing with our daughter and just believe that this is truly a must for every parent!

It seems like they added those last elements in the car on the way to the factory and gave them 5 minutes thought. Instructions for any good way to connect these is non-existent.Takes forever to put up and take down the tent canopy and it is also terribly designed and very unpractical.Zero reinforcement where the velcro and wooden beams meet at the fabric mat for sturdyness sake.For $140...

It has so many aspects that unlike other cheaper ones, he doesn’t get bored. Plus when you open the box you can just tell the quality is so good. I was worried about the white fabric with a baby who spits up but the material has some kind of layer on it where it just kind of wipes off which is awesome-dust and dog hair are definitely seen on it but you can easily brush or shake it off.Tip: For newer babies who can’t reach the toys on it yet I clipped on the Manhattan Toy Wimmer-Ferguson Stim-Mobile To Go mobile ($12) and once they can start grabbing you can use those cheap colorful chain links ($5) for them to grab at and to attach the toys from the mobile (like the ball) on to.

If I put him down anywhere else he cried and needed to be held, but everything they've designed for his age keeps him curious and entertained. It's amazing. Get one for your nephew!!!!"" That's a pretty convincing review, so, of course, I got one!When my son was born - 12 years ago - the play mats were basically a blanket with a noisy stuffy attached.

            "|MS|August 19, 2019|Verified Purchase|4|"Overall this is a great play gym. We’ve had for 4 months now and our LO loves playing in this play gym. It’s been a joy to watch our little one be entertained for long periods of time with all of the different sections and the hanging toys. The cards in the learn to focus zone and the making sounds section are particular favorites along with the wooden batting ring. We also love the guide that comes with the gym and gives useful suggestions for how to play with your baby at different ages with both the toys and the play gym. The colors are fun and the simplicity is great. With our first kid we had a different playgym and while there were some clear advantages with the other play gym, this one is still our preferred play gym - especially because of the educational nature of the accessories / toys that this play gym has.That being said, there are a few things that could be improved with this product to make it a 5 star product:1) Fabric - the fabric is a magnet for dust and dirt. It’s very easy to clean, but it’s annoying how much clings to this to begin with2) Cushion- the mat is somewhat thin and lacking in cushion. This is especially important for babies that are learning to sit up as they can fall hard. We have hardwood floors with padding under area rugs but we still had to put a foam mat under this play gym to provide some better cushion. With our old play gym we didn’t need to do this as it was sufficiently padded3) modify learn to focus zone - this is one of our LO’s favorite activity however I wish the velcro was not on the bottom section of the mat so when you remove the learn to focus zone your LO is not rolling around on velcro which is itchy if they don’t have pants on4) rough edges on wood - as other reviews have noted, there are some unfinished / rough sections on the wooden batting ring and the wooden legs of the gym. I don’t really mind the rough edges on the legs because on ours these spots are towards the highest part where our LO won’t be touching, but the batting ring is another story - there really shouldn’t be unfinished rough parts on something that a baby’s hand is touching and their mouth is potentially touching. We took some sandpaper to smooth ours out and then put a thin coat of beeswax to seal the wood.5) tummy time pillow - for the price it would have been nice if it came with a tummy time pillowOverall I think this is a great product and I would recommend to friends. This review is my own opinion and I did not receive any compensation or discounted or free product for this review.

            "|A Mccaffre|July 7, 2019|Verified Purchase|5|"First, I do wish the mat was a bit cheaper, but be sure to add it to your amazon baby registry. If no one buys it for you, you get 10 or 15% off, which does make a high priced item like this more affordable.I looked through a lot of playmats before buying this one. I wish the arms were a bit easier to put up, but after a few times of assembling and disassembling, I’m pretty quick at it. We have a small house, so I need something that can fold up and be put away between uses. We store the arms behind our play yard. After a month of constant use, it seems sturdy and like it will hold up to being put up and taken down everyday.I also like that this mat doesn’t have a million bells and whistles and isn’t so “baby” looking. It encourages my husband and I to be on the ground and playing with our baby while she’s on the mat, which I think is important. I also love the activity book that came with the mat and the toys too— these are really versatile and give us lots of ideas for play.I have hung an additional toy from the middle a few times, but I find my baby interacts with all the toys on the arms, even though she can’t roll yet and there isn’t one in the center. I noticed this was a negative for a lot of reviewers but it doesn’t hurt the usefulness of the mat in our household.

The mat itself is soft and the whole play gym is a solid construction. It is not overwhelming for my young baby. I am excited for him to begin exploring the additional zones as he gets older. I am really impressed, especially compared to our other playgym, which is a popular brand. Totally worth the money.

            "|The Shoo Shack|December 10, 2019|Verified Purchase|5|"There are much cheaper options I admit but I was set on this from before baby was born.  I wanted the learning activities and the size of the mat was attractive to me.  The ""learn to focus"" section is GREAT for newborns.  I put baby down on his tummy every day and sometimes on his back and he loves looking at the black and white cards.  They sit up at a nice angle that really encourages him to look over at them.  I can't wait to use more of the features!  A few notes...1) It is very large.  I put it on my queen bed and it's almost edge to edge.  Right now I'm just using the mat (not the bars) since he can't really see the things that dangle down.  It's still very useful for the ""learn to focus"" and I like the size being so large.2) It's colorful and fun, playful and the book that comes with activites is USEFUL!  For someone who doesn't have time to plan out step by step activities it takes the thinking out of things so I can sleep with my downtime! :)  Very useful for a first time Mom.3) It does fold up and put away nicely.  It's not quick though to take it apart and put away and that's why right now I'm just using the mat and learn to focus section.  Long term - I need a larger space to put this thing and for a smaller home or minimalist this might not be your best option.4) It's GREAT quality.  Product is holding up nicely!

I was searching for a gym, but it seemed like all the gyms I looked at were so bright, made a bunch of noise, and overly patterned. I was overwhelmed looking at them, and I imagine they could easily overstimulate a baby. This gym is great because the sides can fold up so that the gym isn't too stimulating! Although it is pricy, it is so worth it because of quality and the length of time you'll get use from it! The quality is great; everything is fabric, wood, or silicone. I also like that it can turn into a tent for toddlers, so it's not something you get rid of as they grow but instead grows with them.

The Play Gym by Lovevery; Stage-Based Developmental Activity Gym & Play Mat for Baby to Toddler|"Terrible for small apartments.
            "|Elizabeth H Anderson|June 15, 2019|Verified Purchase|3|"One big design flaw— storage/breakdown. If you live in a small space and plan on storing this gym away in a corner or a closet when it’s not in use, this product is not for you.1. The wooden bars don’t fold up. They have to be screwed together at the top and velcro-ed on the corners. Is it hard? No, but it’ll take you a good 2-3 minutes to put together and another minute to take it apart. The plastic piece at the top is horribly inefficient. If this was designed better the wood bars would puzzle piece together all on their own in a few seconds.2. So now your little angel has had some tummy time but you have guests coming over and you’d like to store it away. Once you take apart the gym and all the books and toys that go with it, what do you do with them all? There’s no bag or means by which to keep all the various parts together and prevent them from getting lost. Imagine buying a board game and not being given a container to prevent the dice and playing cards from getting lost. For example, they give you about 20 flash cards and not so much as a butterfly clip to keep them together— and there’s a lot of parts! If Lovery was smart, the mat would have a pocket on the bottom of it where you could store the instructions, flash cards, and the horribly unnecessary plastic piece that connects the wooden bars at the top. It would then come with a cloth bag where you could store the play mat (with all the additional pieces in it) and wooden bars together.3. Unrelated to small apartment living, but the “touch” section of the mat is kind of lame. The sensory materials aren’t different enough. I might sew on some felt or something fuzzy as per the suggestion of another reviewer.Conclusion: if you live in a house or a large space, or have every intention of rarely or never storing it away, this is a wonderfully well thought out mat. I just wish the designers had spent as much time considering the functionality of the package design as they did the child development piece.

            "|GraceO|November 19, 2019|Verified Purchase|5|"Like many have already said, this is an expensive playmat! And, as others have also acknowledged, it is so worth it! I got this when my baby was only a couple of weeks old. She's our first, so I wanted to get a playmat that seemed like it would last from child to child, but would also age with my baby. This fits that want perfectly!I'm writing this review with my 9 week old in mind- just so those reading this have an age range in mind =).I started using this with my baby right from the start. So, at two weeks, I laid her in front of the black and white flash cards, and she focused on them for a minute or two at a time. With that kind of focus already, I felt like I'd purchased the perfect playmat. I also felt like I was making good use of the little waketime she had at that age.As the weeks have gone by we've added more interactions with the black and white cards. I love the instructional ring that comes with this mat! It suggested I take a card out and move it back and forth so my little one could track it. She's great at that now!Two weeks ago she started reaching for, and hitting, the black and white ball. I was amazed she could actually reach for and hit the ball! She also likes hitting the wooden grasping toy with the bell with her feet.She's just now starting to smile, coo, and yell...my husband and I can hardly get a reaction out of her, but the ball and black and white cards do! We joke that the ball is her best friend. She'll smile, yell, and talk to it!I feel like this playmat lets our baby have safe, independent, and purposeful play. She doesn't mind laying there for a good portion of her awake time because she loves interacting with the components around her. I love watching her discover the different toys and just interact with this mat!One thing that I added to my baby's playtime while on this mat is a black and white picture book. I lay her parallel to the black and white cards and then put the book on the other side. This promotes her turning her head to either side to look at the different objects! She seems to respond well to that set up and will look to her left at the cards for a minute or two and then look to her right for another couple of minutes! She's doing a great job focusing and moving those neck muscles!I don't usually right this long of a review for products I've purchased, but this playmat is so worth it!Side note: the green teething ring that comes with the Hiding and Finding section of the mat is hard to find. I did not realize I would actually have to participate in the “hiding and finding” section...I thought the teething ring just didn’t come with the mat. It did. It was just hidden in one of the green pockets...it took me like two weeks to realize it was there the whole time.

            "|jaime quigley|June 8, 2019|Verified Purchase|2|"My daughter has been on this play mat since she was a week old. She didn't seem to care about it until she hit 4 months and then it was her favorite place to be! I loved the suggestions for those early weeks and I love that the ant is non toxic, however as soon as I washed it, it COMPLETELY fell apart. I washed it on a hand wash cycle and let it air dry, and yet all the seams came apart. I thought I had trimmed them all and then my daughter found another and it got tangled around her. NOT OKAY. For the price of this mat it should not fall apart like that and be such a hazard. It is for babies and will need to be washed frequently

            "|Bryan Harris|June 18, 2019|Verified Purchase|5|"I’m a first time mom to an almost 4 month old. I can’t speak to the this in comparison to other play gyms but this has been one of our favorite purchases for our baby!Some of our favorite things:1. It’s beautiful. I love that the mat is mostly gray and white and the pops of color come from the peripheral stations. It’s a nice (and calming) addition to our living room. I assume the coloring is intentional, to get the child to focus on one station at a time, rather than be overwhelmed by too much stimuli.2. It’s already provided hours of play! It’s been so fun to see our little boy progress through the different stations. When he was about 3 weeks old (maybe even younger) we put him under the black and white ball. Even at that young it totally caught his attention and he began trying to play with it. Then we moved pretty quickly to the black and white cards for tummy time. Now he’s engaging with 4/5 stations and all of the hanging toys. His favorite thing is to lay under the ball with his feet on the crinkly section to make a lot of (non-obnoxious) noise!3. The toys are velcroed on, so they can travel! What a nice perk. Plus two of the toys are teethers which is super helpful, especially now.4. We’ve had one blow out on it and it was very easy to wash and the stain came out well. I think it says a lot that I missed it while waiting for it to dry!5. It can be broken down to travel well. Obviously not a necessity but still nice!I know this is on the pricey side, but we think it is well worth it for the physical quality, intentional design, and versatility it provides! We can’t wait to transform it into a tent when our little one is old enough!

Quality is far, far superior to other mats in the $50-70 range, especially in regards to the toy attachments. I can imagine paying $15-$20 for the b&w ball, or the wooden rattle and both are a major hit with our little one. I’m also in love with the plastic sleeves that hold contrast cards, etc. and I’ve started inserting my own photos and artworks (I’ve even got one of babies ultrasound photos in there right now, she loves the b&w!!) Washes well in the machine (even on hot, though they recommend cold) and sun dries quickly.

The toys and mat flaps are full of low tech, but high engagement activities. The main mat part has also held up well from many spit up and messy diaper changes. We are so pleased with both the quality and design. I can tell this mat will continue to grow with our little one. Thank you, Lovery!

I started using it & the high contrast cards with my 1-week old for tummy time, and now that she is almost 3 months old, we are utilizing the entire gym (sounds, textures). I love the simplicity of it, no frilly zoo animals or boring primary colors. The mat is easy to wash by throwing it in the washing machine, but with the squeaker and crinkle piece attached, I'm not sure how hygienic that will be in the long run. I lay it out in the sun to dry completely. I'm a first-time mom and don't know how to keep a baby entertained, but with the book of activities, I have numerous ideas to try. It's been really fun watching my baby interact with the gym, from the cards to the sturdy wood bell, everything was carefully designed to keep baby engaged. The only thing I wish was different was that that is was quicker to put together, or had a pop open feature.

I didn’t realize how useless that one was until we started using this one. It allows your baby to do so much more than lie on their backs and bat at toys. It is great for tummy time because the mat is much larger and the bars are higher so the baby has some room to raise their head without getting whacked with hanging toys. The built in mirror is great for tummy time too - my little guy loves it. This mat will also really grow with your baby - since the bars are higher they can sit under them once they are sitting. It’s seems sturdy and well made but we will see how it holds up with the two toddlers! Overall it’s been great!

For reference he is 6 months and we've used it since he was three months. The best thing we did was buy a separate toy to hang from the top - a little bee hive that has a hanging bee that you pull on and it play as song. That is really that only reason my son likes laying on this. Again, I like the look but has has ALOT more fun/is more entertained with when he's in the cheaper fischer price ones at daycare and hat church that has more things hanging from it.

I had to buy several other toys to add to it to make it more exciting and stimulating for my baby. The tent thing is not great either, it just flops inward and there isn't a way to keep it bubbled out and more spacious.

I was an early childhood teacher and it is clear that an expert very thoughtfully designed every piece of this play mat! Great for the smallest newborn and my 2 year old also enjoyed it while I was setting it up. I also love the wood structure because I feel that my newborn is safe when the 2 year old is playing around him.

We decided to do the Montessori approach for our baby and this play gym fulfills a lot of the Montessori thinking without having us breaking our bank (the mirrors, black and white cards, developmental activities mapped out like a learning journey, the just-right stretch challenges). The quality of this product is amazing! Everything is so soft and I can totally picture our baby in this safe yet stimulating environment and I feel like after months of searching for the silver bullet baby toy, I can finally sleep at night knowing my child will receive the brain development she will need at every stage in year one. I want to thank whoever designed this for such a wonderful product.

I thought all the learning activities would be so great, but my baby just didn't take to them and I ended up buying a ton of additional hanging toys and straps to keep him occupied-also he kept getting stuck on the wooden arms when he rolled so I had to return.  The size of the mat is great, it is soft, and like that it is not as loud as some other play gyms. I think it may work for some people, but again for the price I don't think it is worth the money.  It is more attractive than anything else.

            "|Kyle Atwood|February 26, 2019|Verified Purchase|5|"This play gym has been great so far and I love that it is so beautiful! What I love most is that it truly grows with your child through each stage and you can see that instantly. I actually didn't pull this out for a few weeks when my son was first born because I thought he was too young for it but after getting it out I wish I would've had it out from the beginning. We had a developmental therapist over working with my other child and she was asking about the play gym and mentioned she had purchased a play gym for her daughter but wasn’t impressed with it and was wishing she had something similar to this one. I am excited to see my son learn and grow with it and begin to explore all of its elements!

I love the book that comes with it and tells you where your baby is at developmentally and how to best play with them (although the information in there can be found elsewhere too). My baby loves to look up at the black and white ball. If you are unsure of the price I think it's worth it but I did buy it from gift cards though and probably would have kept looking for something cheaper if I didn't have gift cards. Overall I am happy with this product!

This baby gym is beautifully done and well made but my fav part is that it comes with a deck of cards that help you use it to your baby’s learning advantage.  It’s neutral but suprisingly colorful inside. I do wish it was smaller because it takes up a lot of space and not that easy to break down and store.  It does not store flat without taking it completely apart. Also there’s no storage place for the extra cards, book, and tent so I’m trying to not lose it. The hanging wood toy is a little large daughter knocked her head on it a few times I had to remove it and just use it without it hanging. I love the design nothing like it it there.

My two year old was way too big for the tent part, which is why I bought it. We have a seven week old and a two year old and I thought they could both enjoy it. I was wrong. It is definitely for a baby. Night grown with baby up to one years old, but after that, it is much too small. If you have y’all children, you won’t get that much time.It is a very pretty gym, and the simplicity is great. However, it is not worth the price. Skip Hop has the silver lining activity gym which is similar for less than half the cost. Print out some picture cards for baby and there you go! I like the idea of this gym, but the price needs to go down to make it five star worthy!

            "|Emma-Lily Schmitz|June 21, 2018|Verified Purchase|4|"It's been a nice little placemat for our baby - but all the extra ""developmental"" stuff really was just extra 'fluff'.  For the price, I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone.  There are far cheaper options that are just as good, and simple toys and/or just playing with your child will accomplish the same things (probably better actually).  Judging the product just on what it is though; it's sturdy and well built.  The books it comes with are nice, and it looks pretty on the floor, even when no one is using it.  So product wise, it's a 4-star in my book.Again though, the pitch on this is for the ""5 developmental zones"" - but our experience is that it was almost never used for this purpose.  Everyone's kid is different of course, but our baby wasn't interested in anything this play gym has to offer, and just wants to look/talk/play with us or his toys.  Will likely end up giving this away, and never missing it.

I like the overall look, colors, and the idea of organic fabric and wooden frame instead of plastic (By the way, it is not solid wood. It is engineered wood. It’s not a bad thing, just know the difference)I hope we get more use out of it as my baby gets older.

            "|Julia|September 19, 2018||5|"We couldn’t be happier with our Play Gym! Our three-month-old is very engaged with all of the accessories and is using them to grasp, pull and roll over with gusto. It’s our go-to spot for tummy time. We’re almost to the “putting everything in our mouth” phase so I love that all of the teething toys are organic and sustainable. The quality of all of the materials is top-notch and the mat has held up well to a couple of trips through the washer (thanks to some exploding diapers.)Even though this is baby number two we refer to the play guide all the time. I wish that we had this for our first son! The one that we had for him was an eyesore with over-stimulating noises and lights. As a bonus to all of the thoughtful developmental features, it’s the one baby thing that actually looks great sitting around the house. The design is modern and we’re totally happy to see it sitting out in the living room. (We’re graphic designers and this passes the test.) It'll definitely be on the top of my list for future baby shower gifts.Can’t say enough good things about it; we LOVE it!

            "|Tonilyn|December 22, 2017|Verified Purchase|4|"*Another Update: I recieved a replacement gym, but the white part was scuffed again. This time the toys were already attached to the gym instead of loosely in the package. They did not add in a plastic teether ring this time. No wooden teether ring, just the silicone ring. The wood on the rattle was quite lighter than the original one I got. I am really grateful that they were kind enough to send me a replacement but some of my original concerns hold true...for some reason their products are getting scuffed up. I highly advise they change apart of their production process to change that.*Update: they contacted me immediately. They seem to have amazing customer service. I am very impressed with the politeness and speed of help I recieved.Overall seems to be good quality fabrics, but there were a few things that bothered me. In my opinion, this is an expensive play mat, and so I expected the best possible product. For the most part, the products seem high quality, but some parts of my order bothered me...and if you're a perfectionist, they might bother you too. The white piece that connects the wood on top came scratch and dirty, like it had been gliding across a garage floor or something. That was the first disappointment due to the fact that it was the first thing you see when you look down at the play mat. The teether that came with the set was just a cheap hunk of plastic...I purchased this based on the fact that it was mostly made of natural materials and was advertised that all the toys were plastic free. On the picture inside it shows a wooden teether. Instead I received a white plastic teether ring and a ""free gift"" of 2 silicone teether rings. I was really disappointed with that. The montessori ball is firm and made of nice fabric, but there were tons of threads sticking out. The toy with the bell had many scuffs and stains on the white parts as well. The actual mat seems high quality, but the accessories seemed average quality and poorly taken care of through production.

AND it is so pretty and easy to assemble/disassemble if you wanted to take it on a road trip or to grandparents house :) my baby is a big spit-upper so i foresee a lot of spot-cleaning in my future but i think it is machine-washable? i'm not sure if i would for fear of making it get raggedy, but maybe i'm just being a nervous nelly :) i wish i could have registered for this!!!

Setup was simple. I wish we had something his nice for my kids when they were young. The 5 stations are great ways for any baby to engage the world around them with sounds, colors, textures and so on. I also like that there are other activities for the baby as they grow; the hanging toys and the interchangeable cards. Very excited to give this to my daughter and I am sure she and her baby will love it. Nice and sturdy too - I feel like this is very worth the cost. My wife wondered about cleanup and we found in the instructions that yes, this can easily be washed to take care of any spills or mishaps. Overall we are very pleased with such a nice product.

I felt compelled to share how much we love their product but even more so about how great their customer service is. When we received our playgym, there were a few faint stains on parts of the fabric. It really wasn’t much of a big deal, but I emailed the company with a few photos just to ask them if they knew what it might be so I could try to get them out. They emailed me back saying that was not acceptable and were immediately sending me another mat and an additional set of black and white cards. They did not ask to send back the first mat, but instead I could do with it what I wish, perhaps donating it to another baby. So their customer service is top notch, but the gym is also amazing! My 6 week old is having quite a fun time looking at the black and white cards and kicking the rattle with her feet. I know this gym is not cheap and it was an investment for us, but the quality is very high and it truly does grow with your baby. I for one have been trying to limit our plastic intake and the world is chock full of plastic baby crap. This product is quite refreshing.

He especially likes the wooden toy with a bell, as it gives him feedback every time he hits it. He also spends tummy time with his head up looking at the black and white designs in the Learn to Focus zone, and has recently begun to look at himself in the mirror.The play mat makes a crunchy sound and squeeks when he kicks the Making Sounds zone. He smiles and kicks harder.The play mat itself is easy to care for. When it gets dirty, I wash it in cold water and hang it to dry overnight, and it comes out looking like new.The play gym is solid wood and was easy to assemble. I watched the assembly video on the Lovevery website, and it took less than 15 minutes to put together. It feels solid and substantial, and I have no concerns about it tipping or falling on the baby.This is a great item to put on your baby registry. I wish that I had it in the first month for tummy time. I can see that the activities are really making a difference in his development!

She enjoys hitting the bell toy that make noise and and likes rolling around on the large soft surface the play gym is beautiful and fits in aesthetically in my house as opposed to her previous play gym which had bright obnoxious colors. I don’t personally care for the bright colored child products so I am happy with the appearance of this play gym. The mat is great for tummy time, especially with the mirror cards, although they distort the reflection. The cards are easy to insert and my only suggestion on the cards is that the paper seems rather thin, so I’m not sure how they will hold up if my little one tries to grab at them while we are having learning time with them. It would be nice if they were laminated because you know how easy it is for baby products to get dirty with a little one around. I like the way the toys are made and they seem sturdy and durable. Everything about the mat seems to be well crafted and well thought out.It would be nice if you had information on your website about the country of origin because that was one thing of surprise to me. I guess for the price I was expecting a country other than China as the manufacturer, and think it may be valuable to have information on sourcing of labor for consumers.All in all, I am pleased with the purchase and look forward to seeing my little one grow and learn on it. I look forward to seeing what other products you develop!

            "|Drew Sarrett|March 28, 2018||5|"I love this play gym.  I didn't even want to buy a play gym for our daughter because most of them are so ugly, but I think this one is super cute.  And, our 3 month old really loves it!  The straps for the hanging toys were kind of short, but there was a card in our box that said to email Lovevery for longer straps if you wanted them.  I did, and the new straps are a much better length.  I also love that it is washable.  I read another review stating that it isn't really washable, but I have washed mine twice so far with no problem.  You just have to remove the ""Learn to Focus Center"" (and wipe it down) and let the rest air dry.

The Play Gym by Lovevery; Stage-Based Developmental Activity Gym & Play Mat for Baby to Toddler|"A fun mat with some great features, but in need of improvements
            "|anonymous|November 16, 2017|Verified Purchase|3|"This is a nice mat, but, especially given its price point, it needs some significant improvements. It is bigger than many other playmats and there is no way to store it. It seems like it would be easy to make a top mechanism that would allow for collapsing of the legs and then you could wrap the mat around for storage. This is really disappointing because it takes up a ton of floor space (more than any other piece of baby gear we own) and there’s no way I can leave the mat out all the time. I wish there were more going on in the center of the mat. The pattern there would be better if higher contrast. The wooden toy can snap on fingers. This happened to my toddler while playing with it. I’ll likely replace it soon. I love the cards and book. All in all, I like it, and will keep it, but hope to see some improvements in future versions.

            "|sharon|January 28, 2019||5|"I absolutely love this new play gym!  From the ease of set up, Hugh quality materials (all wood frame instead of plastic) so easy to wipe down and not the usual bright obnoxious colours found on most play gyms. . I love the way there are different areas for the baby to explore as they grow and the conversion to a tent is amazing.  I have gifted 3 of them now and the new parents love it so much which makes me feel that I am not buying rubbish that will go in a landfill.  The quality is so good it can be passed down and across to friends and family.  I wish I had this when my kids were small, but I get to give it to my god children and friends which makes me so happy.  It is my go to gift for all the new babies.

I had another for my first two kids and I wasn't sure this purchase would be worth the money for my third, but it totally was!It's easy to assemble and clean.  When my baby went to the bathroom on it, I put it on a speed cycle in the washing machine and hung it dry and it was all better!It is vibrant and soft and doesn't smell (I do not like that chemical smell on other play mats).The toys are great quality attached or unattached from the play gym.The Baby Play Book that comes with it is darling and has great information on developmental stages and suggestions for play and development during those stages.I thought the learning cards were silly, but my baby actually loves them. He stares at them often.  They change based on age and stage as well.Also love that they featured a photo of a kid with Downs Syndrome in their product,  thanks for being inclusive.

            "|CE|March 14, 2019||3|"I received this as a gift (ordered from amazon) and wanted to like it, but there were just so many synthetics in this product I did not feel comfortable with my baby mouthing it, so we returned it and got the Finn & Emma gym instead. We have hung mobiles & all sorts of things on the Finn & Emma.I did not like that the mat is polyester and the ball has polyester fiberfill - the USDA I believe has said that polyfill is a toxic substance, so I do not know that I would call that ""baby safe.""Also, even medical grade silicone leaches toxins, so I was not comfortable with a silicone teether.There are a couple synthetics that I was not sure exactly what they were (and therefore how toxic they are), like clear plastic windows & crinkles.From an entertainment perspective it does seem to entertain babies, and I like that it is not electronic & has montessori elements. I like the solid wood parts and that it has many things to do with baby, but since the majority was synthetic, I would have only kept the wood rattle, frame & cards. Maybe the ball with supervision to be sure it never went in a mouth. Since I had no idea what the cardholder clear plastic is made of, I wouldn't have used that part either. I just did not think it made sense for the price to keep just those 2-4 pieces, so we decided to return and get the Finn & Emma gym and playmat which we love. We add all sorts of things to that that did not come with it, and their toys are all solid wood, organic cotton & wool fill.

            "|Jeanette Behrens|December 17, 2018||3|"Weve had this gym for almost 5 months now and I wanted to leave some feedback. I purchased this particular gym summer of 2018 bc I loved the simple look to it, but also bc of the tent. I have a 4 month old and a 4 yr old. The 4 yr old loves the tent and I love that they lay in it together and play. The construction is good quality, and I have washed the mat several times already according to washing instructions (more on that later) and it has always come out great. However...My baby does get bored. I wish there was some sort of simple music item to it. Im constantly having to change out the toys, even using some that didnt come with it. But it IS meant for you to interact with your baby on. My baby has no interest in the flaps - except the one with the squeakers - we get a big laugh when he goes on a kicking frenzy at them - and no interest in the cards. I love how BIG the square footage of the mat is when fully unfolded. But...back to the mat...my BIGGEST issue/pet peeve with it is that it attracts EVERYTHING! We dont even have a pet but if we did, I just cannot ever imagine owning this. The material attracts every single hair, lint, piece of dust, etc within a 6 ft radius! Its so annoying. I could wash it once a week and it would still be full of stuff. So far it has been okay for us - I hope he plays on it more as he gets older, but I honestly dont feel its worth this price point. If I hadnt gotten it from a giftcard, I would not have purchased it.

            "|Jessica|August 1, 2019||4|"I received this as a gift for my 3 month old son. It's a great gym, he enjoys laying down and grabbing at the hanging toya and the cards and mirror are great to encourage tummy time. It's also big enough that he will probably use it for awhile and as advertised, the activities seem to grow with the baby. However, there are a couple of things I wish were different. First, I wish the mat was made out of a material that was easier to wipe down (you have to put the whole thing in the washer). My son spits up and drools all over it and so it gets dirty quickly. Also, as others have pointed out it seems to attract lint and dust pretty easily. Second, I wish it was easier to take apart and put away. We live in a small house and it takes up a good amount of space when we set it up in our living room area for him to play.I also found after receiving this that my son seems just as happy with a Fisher price playmat we got for travel. It's smaller so it won't grow with him like the every, but the toys are easier to grab and I think the smaller size just makes it feel more manageable. So, if you are trying to save $ I don't think this is a must have.

From only a few days after birth to almost six month old, this set has been a great way for our little one to play and be stimulated. Plus, it’s far more aesthetic than other play mats, and can be easily washed, which makes mom very happy.The cards and pop up holder were great to catch our baby’s attention when he was little and hated tummy time. We would prop him up with a boppy pillow and then he could see more.We don’t use the actual mat much anymore, but the bars are great to move around and take over to the grandparents house. We also attach other toys to the bars, and switch them out to keep the baby interested.  They are so durable and well constructed!Combined with the LoveEvery PlayKits, we have barely needed any other toys. The wooden batting toy looks weird, but is surprisingly fun for babies from an early age where they’re just discovering how to move their body, to four-five months when they start to grab and put things in their mouth.I do wish it included a bag or carrying case of some kind, and wish there was a toy included with rings that can be grasped and pulled (retractable?). We have a Lamaze toy that was invaluable to hang from the bars.

So nice to receive developmentally appropriate toys for our son every couple of months and have guidance on how to engage him in play in a way that meets him where he is, but also encourages him to learn and grow!

            "|Martie K.|March 29, 2018||4|"I have mixed feelings on this play gym.It looks very nice, I love the book that comes with it, and my daughter seems to really engage with the activities.  These are all huge pros.It does, however, have some flaws.  The first one I received arrived dirty, and I had to exchange it.  Some of the notches to hang toys are too high, making it difficult for a young baby to reach them.  We added additional rings to lower the toys that our baby couldn’t reach.  The wooden toy also seems a little dangerous.  My daughter loves it and bats at it to no end, but it is heavy, and when she is lying down it swings right at face level.  I try to position her so that it cannot reach her face/head, and I hover over her whenever she is playing with it.I wish you could throw it right in the washer.

            "|Katlyn Heaphy|January 8, 2018||4|"I think its such an awesome playmat, just disappointed in the picture vs. what we received. The toy attachments are not long at all, not even close to the length of the pictures. I wish it came with longer attachments so my 3 month old can actually reach the toys.

            "|Iesha Lane|September 25, 2018||1|"Unfortunately, the item I received seems to have been used prior to me receiving it. It’s been repackaged and some of the items have obviously already been put together. The teething ring is missing, not that I would want my child to receive a used teething ring.  Seeing as to how this is an item for my infant I would prefer to have received a new play gym altogether.

            "|Ana Cristina Camelo|April 2, 2018||2|"The wood parts are not stable my toddler pushed one of the legs and thank goodness my baby was not underneath but it just fell part. It is not easy to move from one room to another. It is really pretty and I really wanted to like it but its not safe or practical.
