I’m going back to work soon (only 6 weeks after delivery) and love that I will have meaningful ways to play with my baby when my time is limited.They have a subscription box too that I want

<td>Love this baby gym. I was going to buy some new toys for baby number 3 and found this baby gym online. I really liked it and it had amany of the tips that I planned to buy plus the tent feature. I decided to get this for him for Christmas. He was 4 months at the time. We have got a lot of use out of it already

<td>We got this when my son was 6 weeks old. At that age we used the black and white cards and I was surprised to see how he could focus on them and track them. Now that he is almost 6 months he enjoys laying on his back and batting the dangling toys. The wooden toy with the bell is his favorite! The card holder is great for displaying the cards and allowing baby to touch without ruining them. There is a good variety of subjects on the cards and these are fun to go through with your baby. This is the only baby item I have that continues to keep my little guy happy

<td>My 3 month old loves this playgym! I’ve been using it since the moment I received it and it’s useful from the youngest of ages. I’m so excited to continue using it and utilize more of it last features. The cards and mirrors that are interchangeable are so nice! When he gets bored I just change them out and capture his interest again. I also love the design of this playmat. I wanted something that would not be an eyesore like so many baby objects are with the loud colors and obnoxious plastic objects everywhere. The wooden poles are stylish and safer than plastic

<td>We bought this for baby #2 because this wasn’t around when we had our first. We’ve had other play gyms that are popular and cheaper but none of them compare to this one! I fell in love with the packaging alone. The materials are so well made. The activity book is so great and can really give new parents a better idea of how to help baby learn and grow in those earlier months. The mat is super durable. The canopy is so cute and purposeful (I didn’t even consider how it can helps guide forward movement). My toddler is infatuated with this

<td>We are very happy with this product. We have received multiple complements on it and have had two friends purchase it after seeing it (and having their kids play with it) in our home.A few of the things we like...Space: I love that there is space on the mat for our 10 week old to be able to rotate 360 degrees (with our help) to interact with the cards and hanging pieces from different angles.The fabric: It is good looking! It is also soft and has been very easy to spot clean (spit up).Play guide: The book is so incredibly helpful! It is great knowing that I have an evidence based quick reference when it comes to how to engage my baby in play/mental stimulation.This play gym is more expensive than others

<td>I absolutely love this play gym! It is everything I wanted and very solidly made. It is a good looking piece as well - nice enough to leave out most of the time.The best part of this gym is the activity booklet that comes with it. It tells you how to use the gym at each age/developmental level. My almost 3-month-old loves to kick the “sounds” zone and the hanging bell to hear the noises. He also loves to look at the Montessori ball as it swings or look at the black and white pattern cards during tummy time. Tummy time used to be his least favorite activity

My baby boy now 3 months loves to look at the high contrast images and swat at the high contrast ball. Perhaps the best part about this play gym is that it comes with a book that shows parents age appropriate ways to play with their children.

Both of our babies loooove the bell toy. My little guy kicks at it forever! I like that it is made with organic materials and has the option to open and close the side areas so it isn’t overstimulating.

<td>Bought this for my twins to play on and it is a nice size to contain &amp; entertain them for when they are not mobile. The &quot;learn to focus&quot; board would be better with support for the fold flap to resist babies collapsing it and contorting it against the wooden post behind it: I&#39;ve got a roll of another play mat thing to give it support for when my baby climbs over it. The &quot;how things feel&quot; area was a bit of a disappointment in that the different materials really aren&#39;t all that different: the grosgrain ribbon texture is repeated as is the cotton feeling ones. And realistically the panels do not stay folded over once babies are on there &amp; wiggling around. But at least everything is beautiful to look at and not overly busy. I like the cards it comes with and suggested ways to play with it at difference developmental stages.

<td>My family is so in love with the play gym. The activity instructions are very helpful for us as new parents since we don’t always know what our daughter needs at each stage of development. It’s hard to find a gym that’s not overstimulating - this keeps her attention and focus without overwhelming her (or us!). I highly recommend!

<td>I like how big and tall this play gym is. My older son likes to play with the baby on the play mat and this gives them plenty of space. My baby will also be able to sit up under it once he sits. I noticed I was adding developmentally appropriate things to keep the baby happy on the other playmat we had. With this one he immediately focused on the black and white images and stayed focused and happy and on his tummy for his longest time yet. Overall the quality is high and hopefully will stay a favorite throughout his first year.

<td>I work in an infant room and we bought this for our kids. The material of the mat is nice and thick. There is even stitching throughout it to make sure the batting doesn’t move. Each flap has a label as to what the sensory is. It’s amazing! The teether is a nice material to chew on. There is one on the mat and one that hangs from the bars with the organic cotton fabric on it. The wooden hanging toy makes a great sound when it is rattled back and forth. The wood of the bars is very durable and stable. Perfect for when our older children come over to the mat. They can’t tip it or knock it down. All of the cards that come with it are great. So many choices to put out. This mat is amazing!! Thank you for the thoughtful design!

<td>We are SO happy with this play gym. I honestly think it’s my favorite thing we bought for our baby. It’s clear how much thought and detail went into the design of this product. Everything is very well made beautiful. I love that you can fold the fabric over the different play stations so that it looks less cluttered when not in use and doesn’t overstimulate while baby’s playing. The booklet that comes with it is also great - full of information on how to use the gym through various developmental stages. We haven’t used the tent

<td>Our baby has been very happy with this play gym.  She is 3 months now and has been loving looking in the mirrors during tummy time and hitting the bell with her hands and feet.  She is just starting to get really interested in the crinkly parts and grabbing at them during tummy time.  Before this stage she was very into starring at the flash cards and black and white ball.  We took some of the flash cards out and put them out in our diaper changing station for her to look at.  I really like that his product will turn into a tent when she no longer needs a play gym.  I also like how the parts are attached - they feel very secure.  It&#39;s nice that you can take the hanging toys off to use them for different things.***Update: 8 months old and still totally obsessed with the bell toy.  Also now interested in rolling around and turning around to play with the crinkly parts and ribbons.

<td>This one is so sophisticated. You have different zones for different stages of development. Our son is still too young to use all of them and is currently just staring at the black and white pictures. I think it&#39;s great and I love the quality of the material. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it&#39;s way more expensive than the other mattresses but we couldn&#39;t find any other that won&#39;t overwhelm our little precious with colors but will still stimulate his senses. It&#39;s a must-have if you have the money for it.

The infant development reminders and activities are helpful - and the interactivity of the mat and accessories are wonderful.

<td>My baby is 10 weeks and he is mesmerized by this gym. Yesterday he laid on his back and looked at the hanging objects for 45 minutes while vigorously kicking his legs and swinging his arms. Usually he can’t go this long without wanting me to pick him up. However he still hates tummy time and the gym doesn’t make him like it any better. But I love the soft cushy mat that gives him adequate protection and comfort even on our hard wood floor

<td>I love this little play gym! My son is 5 months old and he&#39;s been using it for nearly two months now and I can&#39;t wait until we get to use it now interactively. The gym itself is sturdy and well made. I had read from other reviewers that the hanging toys weren&#39;t low enough for younger baby&#39;s to touch

<td>Love all of the activities by age/development time! You can tell it was very well thought out. It is great that it isn&#39;t a loud and over stimulating concept and vainly I love that it looks so nice in her nursery.She loves tummy time on this mat and currently is quite happy with herself that she can grab the bell. We&#39;re traveling later on and like that this packs up pretty easily and washes well too.

<td>This is a wonderful product- not only is it beautiful and sustainably made- my three week old actually enjoys spending time playing on it! We had a fisher price play gym when my son (now 2.5 years) was a baby and he always cried unless I was laying on the play gym with him- it’s not the case with this play gym as it’s been created with baby’s mental development in mind. I also love all the cards to guide play. And my toddler even likes to sit inside when it’s set-up as a tent. Can’t recommend this gorgeous product enough!

<td>Our 9 month old loves playing on the play gym! I thought he would have totally grown out of play mats/activity centers but the lovevery play gym has tons of options for him. The strong wooden frame has been really good as he practices pulling him self up and stabilizing. And he&#39;s been enjoying all the mirrors and learning cards. Best part for us is that it looks much nicer than many of the neon play gyms so it blends into our home

Love that it gives proactive exercises to do with the babes as well.  Their customer service is excellent!  Our little man lost his teething ring and I emailed about replacement expecting to pay for the part and shipping and the customer service couldn’t have been sweeter.  They sent the most cheerful email back and covered all replacement costs including shipping!  Thank you LOVEVERY!

I love the simplicity and the different areas for learning. Love how easily it comes apart for cleaning and I love the book that comes with it to help you help your baby learn as they grow. Such an amazing mat! It is truly beautifully made.

<td>I love the style and durability of this play mat and I think overall it will be a great learning tool for my two month old as time goes on. He will remain focused on the high contrast cards but I constantly find him looking up and unfortunately there is nothing there for him to look at. I ended up adding some little toys so he has something to gaze at. I also find myself grabbing a musical toy I have so he can move around to the sounds which he likes doing. Maybe as he gets older he will be more engaged without the need of the music and added stimulation above his head but currently he still prefers his play mat that lights up and plays music. This mat however is great for engaging with your baby as you learn about your baby’s developmental milestones.  You can see the additions I made to this mat in my photos.

<td>This gym is nice to look at and Baby loves it! She is addicted to bells and immediately started watching me assemble it when she heard me pull the bell/clapper toy from the box. Put up/take down is easy and truly doesn&#39;t require tools. The only thing I&#39;d like to see different would be some longer hangers for the toys - a longer set for the younger/smaller babies and the &#39;shorter&#39; set that&#39;s included now.

<td>Super easy to put together. My husband put it together within a minute or two. Its super cute and big enough sized for my toddler to lay next our newborn. My son is 10 weeks old and loves it. The only unfortunate thing was our two mirrors came with some deep scratches. So when I peeled back the protective layer they were still there. Other than that I&#39;m completely satisfied with my purchase!

<td>This baby gym has been a lifesaver. It keeps my 4-month-old entertained and engaged when I need to get work done at home. I love the sleek design - doesn&#39;t look tacky in our family room. We love the ability to change out the hanging toys and all of the different flaps for baby&#39;s different stages. Worth the investment.

<td>We are expecting our first baby any day now so I can&#39;t say much on use but this play mat seems awesome! I&#39;m really impressed with the quality which I&#39;m glad because I was really on the fence about the price of this item. I ended up purchasing this as its for our first so I feel like we can invest in quality items now that will last through kid #2 or #3. I definitely feel like this will last for many years of play. It doesn&#39;t feel cheap and I&#39;m not worried this will collapse on my baby. I&#39;m also impressed by this company with their book of how to play with your child. I love that the first section is all positive comments for the parent to take a moment and realize you are doing a good job. As I imagine there will be times we feel overwhelmed so I&#39;ll take all the positivity I can get. I loved this quote they have in their play book &quot; Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do&quot; - Benjamin Spock.PS the box showed there is a teething ring include but I didn&#39;t see it. I reached out to Lovevery customer service and they said it&#39;s in the hide and find area so take a look there before you think it&#39;s missing like I did!

<td>I love how easy it is to assemble this play gym. The legs are held together at the top rather than requiring you to get the spacing and tension right to keep them upright. There is also no worry about your baby accidentally kicking one of the legs or one of the legs getting bumped and causing it to collapse. The materials the activity gym is made out of so much nicer and stronger than our previous one. The color scheme of the mat is a great neutral when it is all closed up and put away so I don&#39;t mind it being in my living room and I don&#39;t feel like it is an eye sore to look at. We are in a smaller space right now

<td>As a minimalist family I was hesitant about a larger play gym adding too much to the mix but this has quickly become a great place for our little lady to explore. While most of the “zones” are a little advance at the moment they are going to be great as she grows and wants to explore even more! Overstimulation is such a battle and I love that we can open and close things as needed keeping this gym neat and tidy allowing her to wind down when things get to be too much. We have the first two subscription boxes from Lovevery too and they add just the right amount of versitility to keep our little one curious yet familiar with things. I look forward to seeing her grow with the gym and that it will become a cute tent for her to get creative in later!

<td>I LOVE this play gym. It has been great to have since my baby was 2 weeks old. He is now 5 months old and we use it for the majority of his floor play time and tummy time. The various aspects of it has been stimulating in different ways as he has developed. It is definitely one of our best purchases. It’s washed up perfectly in the washer and is easy to wipe clean for a little spit up or drool. I love that it isn’t tacky like so many play gyms. It’s soft And cushy enough for us to use on our hardwood floors too. If you’re going get a play gym

<td>Me and my daughter LOVE this play gym! She loves how comfy it is and how pretty it is to look at. I love that it&#39;s made of very high quality materials; it doesn&#39;t feel cheap and plasticy like pretty much all other gyms on the market. I also like how it is made with brain development of the little one in mind

<td>We have had this play gym now for a few months and I am very happy with the quality of the materials. It cleans up nicely by wiping up any spit ups and spills. It is machine washable and then I let it air dry. I really enjoy the lite padding the mat has because we have hard wood floors. My now 6 month old loves playing and exploring the play mat. It has also held up to the ruff play of my toddler. This is the second play mat I have purchase now. I feel that this mat really covers my child developmental needs vs just being a place to play.

<td>Looooove this gym! Totally worth the money. Everything is very thoughtfully made. We love how you can change out the cards and mirrors and detach the toys for on the floor play. There are 4 different developmental stations and a tent you can add and take away! This gym also comes with a month by month guide to help stimulate your baby. This is by far our favorite toy. I’m glad we invested in this play gym verses a cheap plastic one. We will use it for all of our children in the future.

<td>Overall this is a great play gym. We’ve had for 4 months now and our LO loves playing in this play gym. It’s been a joy to watch our little one be entertained for long periods of time with all of the different sections and the hanging toys. The cards in the learn to focus zone and the making sounds section are particular favorites along with the wooden batting ring. We also love the guide that comes with the gym and gives useful suggestions for how to play with your baby at different ages with both the toys and the play gym. The colors are fun and the simplicity is great. With our first kid we had a different playgym and while there were some clear advantages with the other play gym

<td>We have so enjoyed this playgym. My babe is 4 months and each detail of this gym is perfect for her growing needs. My favorite part of the gym is the simplicity. It isn’t overstimulating but offers exactly what she needs to let her mind wander and grow. The flash cards tell me exactly what activities she should be doing at each monthly stage. It also gives me ideas of how to interact with my baby and what tools to use.It is very durable and will last for many months to come. I can’t wait for her to explore the hide and seek flap with her brothers. It’s perfect for parents or siblings to get in the floor and spend time learning and playing with your baby at any stage.

<td>Love this play gym! From how much it entertains my 3 month old son to how it looks in the room. There are so many ways for my son to learn from this and I like the guide book it came with to know how to best use each area of the gym. You can tell a lot of thought went into designing it. The material is soft and easy to clean

<td>There are much cheaper options I admit but I was set on this from before baby was born.  I wanted the learning activities and the size of the mat was attractive to me.  The &quot;learn to focus&quot; section is GREAT for newborns.  I put baby down on his tummy every day and sometimes on his back and he loves looking at the black and white cards.  They sit up at a nice angle that really encourages him to look over at them.  I can&#39;t wait to use more of the features!  A few notes...1) It is very large.  I put it on my queen bed and it&#39;s almost edge to edge.  Right now I&#39;m just using the mat (not the bars) since he can&#39;t really see the things that dangle down.  It&#39;s still very useful for the &quot;learn to focus&quot; and I like the size being so large.2) It&#39;s colorful and fun

<td>i wasn’t very satisfied with this play gym. I really liked the idea of it being designed by doctors yadayadayada but at end of the day it was boring. There wasn’t enough things to keep my child busy. The gym is BEAUTIFUL and I loved the neutral and pastel colors especially with my homes decor. However

<td>I contemplated buying this for a some time because it’s so expensive compared to other play gyms. This is the one I wanted though so I ordered it. I’m so glad I did. It’s very high-quality and looks nice in our living  room.  We’ve used this since our baby was a newborn-mainly for tummy time and initially she liked to stare at the black and white ball. She’s now 2 1/2 months old and really enjoys playing with the hanging toys.  The bell was the first toy she ever played with.  We’re looking forward to using the different activity flaps as she grows.  If you want to get it. It’s worth the money.

<td>Wish this had been around for our first daughter! This play gym is SO well designed and really is everything you could want in a play gym. There are tons of activities to promote learning and development (newborn through age 1) and I LOVE that it comes with a “Play guide” with tons of ideas and suggestions of ways to play with your baby. It’s super easy to set up (and take apart to clean) and all parts are made from safe materials you can trust. Would recommend to anyone!

<td>I ordered this play gym for my 3rd baby because our old one had seen better days. I didn’t realize how useless that one was until we started using this one. It allows your baby to do so much more than lie on their backs and bat at toys. It is great for tummy time because the mat is much larger and the bars are higher so the baby has some room to raise their head without getting whacked with hanging toys. The built in mirror is great for tummy time too - my little guy loves it. This mat will also really grow with your baby - since the bars are higher they can sit under them once they are sitting. It’s seems sturdy and well made but we will see how it holds up with the two toddlers! Overall it’s been great!

<td>I love the look of this play gym and it was super easy to set up. My son does like to look in the mirror and one of his favorite toys is one of the hanging toys- we take it off and let him play with the crinkly &quot;tie&quot; and aqua ring. For reference he is 6 months and we&#39;ve used it since he was three months. The best thing we did was buy a separate toy to hang from the top - a little bee hive that has a hanging bee that you pull on and it play as song. That is really that only reason my son likes laying on this. Again

<td>I really did my research on play gyms before purchasing this one. I am in the child development feild so I knew what I was looking for and this gym met those needs. My son LOVES it. It has grown with him thus far. I got it when he was a month old and he is 5 months old now. I am looking forward to using this tool with him for quite some time to come. I love how it turns into a tent as well...which means he can use it for a long time to come. I do wish it was easier to store when not in use. However

<td>I absolutely love this product! I was an early childhood teacher and it is clear that an expert very thoughtfully designed every piece of this play mat! Great for the smallest newborn and my 2 year old also enjoyed it while I was setting it up. I also love the wood structure because I feel that my newborn is safe when the 2 year old is playing around him.

<td>I understand there&#39;s &quot;science&quot; behind the development of this play mat but simply put it&#39;s a lame mat at a high-end price.  I think you&#39;re mainly paying for the birch wood.  Get yourself a real mat that your kids will enjoy.  Then take the saved money and buy yourself a nice dinner.

<td>I love the idea and everything of it... but there’s no way to clean it. I just took it out of the box and played with newborn on it.. and she spits up often... sadly after she spit up I realize it’s ripped on the side. For the price that it is...I didn’t expect it to come ripped! That’s annoying and means it won’t last long at all.. which is the only reason I was willing to pay so much because I figured it would last long. Now even if it could be washed I can’t wash it. 😒 bummer and waste of money.

My little one is currently enjoying the black and white photos and the mirror.

<td>My 12 week old son loves this so far and it has made tummy time a lot easier. I like that it&#39;s something that can be used for a long time and I love that it comes with suggestions for how to play based on your child&#39;s age- that&#39;s probably what impressed me most. I thought the price was a little high

Per my daughter in-law (a mother knows better than a grandpa!) - she loves it - her 4 favorite things are:1)The high contrast card that build focus2) The wooden pieces that are sturdier and more sanitary than plastic3) The booklet with developmental milestones by age4) The watercolor mat decorGreat job - Lovevery Baby!  Great product!

<td>This play gym has been great so far and I love that it is so beautiful! What I love most is that it truly grows with your child through each stage and you can see that instantly. I actually didn&#39;t pull this out for a few weeks when my son was first born because I thought he was too young for it but after getting it out I wish I would&#39;ve had it out from the beginning. We had a developmental therapist over working with my other child and she was asking about the play gym and mentioned she had purchased a play gym for her daughter but wasn’t impressed with it and was wishing she had something similar to this one. I am excited to see my son learn and grow with it and begin to explore all of its elements!

<td>Super easy to put together. I love the book that comes with it and tells you where your baby is at developmentally and how to best play with them (although the information in there can be found elsewhere too). My baby loves to look up at the black and white ball. If you are unsure of the price I think it&#39;s worth it but I did buy it from gift cards though and probably would have kept looking for something cheaper if I didn&#39;t have gift cards. Overall I am happy with this product!

<td>This play gym was on my wishlist for my entire pregnancy but I was hesitant to take the plunge and purchase it because of the price. Well.. it was worth EVERY penny! It is designed beautifully and I love that it helps me with activities to aid my child’s development at each age milestone. I love the toys and cards it comes with and that it can convert to a fun play tent!! The best part? I can throw it in my washing machine! I highly recommend if you’re on the fence like I was!

<td>We used this product for our granddaughter. She started using it at 4 to5 months old and hasn&#39;t stopped since. She immediately loved it and is now beginning to use it to steady herself to stand. She also uses it to rollover and play with other toys...….this has been very useful for our granddaughter and all who watch her. Thanks.

<td>I was so back and forth with buying this because of the price. I&#39;m so glad I did. My 5 week old loves the high contrast images and stares at the ball forever. I cant wait to watch her grow with this and I know she will get tons of use out of it unlike other play gyms on the market that babies grow out of so fast. I also love that it&#39;s not obnoxious looking or overstimulating. If you&#39;re on the fence about this- just get it. It&#39;s well worth the money.

<td>This is my second gym and I gave away my first and thought I’d try a new one for my second kid. This baby gym is beautifully done and well made but my fav part is that it comes with a deck of cards that help you use it to your baby’s learning advantage.  It’s neutral but suprisingly colorful inside. I do wish it was smaller because it takes up a lot of space and not that easy to break down and store.  It does not store flat without taking it completely apart. Also there’s no storage place for the extra cards

I don’t personally care for the bright colored child products so I am happy with the appearance of this play gym. The mat is great for tummy time

<td>Excellent quality Play Gym for our now 5 month old daughter! Love all the Developmental stimuli as it inspires our daughter to explore and learn! Great for tummy time and back time as she loves looking at the contrast cards and hanging toys as she loves touching and grasping at them. It is perfect for each age and we have had it since she was born and she still loves to use it. It even turns into a tent as she gets older! I like knowing it is made of non-toxic materials and I would highly recommend this to anyone with a young child. Thank you

<td>I received this may as a gift and immediately put it together for my 1 month old. She’s now almost 3 months and we only use it occasionally because we have an apartment and we can’t keep it out constantly. The overhead wooden bars have some assembly required and it’s a pain to take down and put together every time. I also wish the fabric had some friction so she could use it for tummy time at this age. It’s very slippery soft. If you have the space to keep it assembled all the time it’s a great playmat with different stations to entertain baby as they grow.
